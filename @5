Class 5 – Loops and Nested Loops in C (Questions and Answers)

1. What is a loop in C?
A loop is a control structure that allows repeated execution of a block of code until a specific condition becomes false.


---

2. What are the types of loops in C?
There are three main types of loops in C:

1. for loop


2. while loop


3. do-while loop




---

3. What is the syntax of a for loop?

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // statements
}


---

4. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


---

5. What is a while loop?
A while loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the given condition is true.


---

6. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:

1 2 3 4 5


---

7. What is a do-while loop?
A do-while loop executes the block of code once before checking the condition. It guarantees at least one execution.


---

8. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do-while loop.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i = 1;
    do {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 5);
    return 0;
}

Output:

1 2 3 4 5


---

9. What is the difference between while and do-while loops?
In a while loop, the condition is checked before the first iteration, whereas in a do-while loop, the condition is checked after executing the loop body.


---

10. Write a program to print even numbers from 2 to 20.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    for (int i = 2; i <= 20; i += 2) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:

2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20


---

11. Write a program to calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum = %d", sum);
    return 0;
}

Output:

Sum = 55


---

12. What is a nested loop?
A nested loop means a loop inside another loop. It is often used for working with multi-dimensional data such as matrices.


---

13. Write a program using nested for loops to print a 3×3 matrix of stars.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:

* * * 
* * * 
* * *


---

14. Write a program to print a right-angle triangle pattern using stars.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *


---

15. Write a program to print a multiplication table of a given number.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n", n, i, n * i);
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:

Enter a number: 5
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
...
5 x 10 = 50


---

16. Write a program using while loop to calculate factorial of a number.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n, fact = 1, i = 1;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (i <= n) {
        fact *= i;
        i++;
    }
    printf("Factorial = %d", fact);
    return 0;
}

Output:

Enter a number: 5
Factorial = 120

17. Write a program to find the sum of digits of a number using a while loop.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n, sum = 0, rem;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n != 0) {
        rem = n % 10;
        sum += rem;
        n /= 10;
    }
    printf("Sum of digits = %d", sum);
    return 0;
}

    int count = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
            printf("%d ", count++);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:

    int n, t1 = 0, t2 = 1, next;
    printf("Enter number of terms: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", t1);
        next = t1 + t2;
        t1 = t2;
        t2 = next;
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:

int main() {
    int n, rev = 0, rem;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n != 0) {
        rem = n % 10;
        rev = rev * 10 + rem;
        n /= 10;
    }
    printf("Reversed number = %d", rev);
    return 0;

Class 13 â€“ Storage Classes in C (Questions and Answers)


---

1. What is a storage class in C?
A storage class defines scope, lifetime, and visibility of variables or functions in a program.


---

2. How many storage classes are there in C?
There are four storage classes in C:

1. auto


2. register


3. static


4. extern




---

3. What is the default storage class of a local variable?
auto is the default storage class for local variables.


---

4. What is the auto storage class?
auto variables are local to the block, created when the block is entered, and destroyed when the block is exited.

Example:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    auto int a = 10;
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}

Output:

10


---

5. What is the register storage class?
register suggests the compiler to store variable in CPU register for faster access. Cannot use & with register variables.

Example:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    register int a = 5;
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}

Output:

5


---

6. What is the static storage class?
static variables retain their value between function calls. Scope is local, but lifetime is throughout the program.


---

7. Write a program to demonstrate static variable.

#include <stdio.h>
void func() {
    static int count = 0;
    count++;
    printf("%d\n", count);
}
int main() {
    func();
    func();
    func();
    return 0;
}

Output:

1
2
3


---

8. What is the extern storage class?
extern is used to declare a global variable that is defined in another file or outside the current function.


---

9. Write a program to demonstrate extern variable.

#include <stdio.h>
int a = 100; // global variable
void display();
int main() {
    extern int a;
    display();
    return 0;
}
void display() {
    extern int a;
    printf("%d", a);
}

Output:

100


---

10. Can static be used with global variables?
Yes, static global variables limit the scope to the file they are defined in.


---

11. What is the scope of auto variable?
Scope is local to the block in which it is declared.


---

12. What is the scope of register variable?
Scope is local to the block in which it is declared.


---

13. What is the scope of static variable?

For local static variables: local to the function/block, but retains value across calls.

For global static variables: scope is limited to the file.



---

14. What is the scope of extern variable?
Global, accessible across multiple files.


---

15. What is the lifetime of auto and register variables?
Lifetime is only during execution of the block in which they are declared.


---

16. What is the lifetime of static variable?
Lifetime is entire program execution, value persists between function calls.


---

17. What is the lifetime of extern variable?
Lifetime is entire program execution (global variable).


---

18. Difference between auto and static local variables?

Feature	auto	static

Lifetime	Block execution	Entire program
Value	Re-initialized each call	Retains value
Scope	Local	Local



---

19. Difference between extern and global variables?

Global variables can be used directly in the file.

extern is used to refer to a global variable defined in another file.



---

20. List all storage classes with their scope and lifetime.

Storage Class	Scope	Lifetime

auto	Local	Block execution
register	Local	Block execution
static (local)	Local	Entire program
static (global)	File	Entire program
extern	Global	Entire program
